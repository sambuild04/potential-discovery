          We believe a well-timed book can change the course of a day—or even a life. When you share a post that hints at stress, curiosity, or a need for fresh perspective, our system quietly reads the tone and topics you've expressed (never the private details). It then matches you with a short, hand-curated list of books—ranging from uplifting fiction to practical guides—that speak directly to what you're feeling or facing. Each recommendation comes with a book name and a reason for recommendation, so you can decide in seconds whether to dive in. If you believe the recommendation is not good enough, please feel free to email us at xpotential2023@gmail.com. We will try our best to find a good book for you.
